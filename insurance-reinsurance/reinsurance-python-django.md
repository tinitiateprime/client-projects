## Introduction
* In this project, we aim to develop a robust data ingestion system using Python Django framework coupled with a database for an insurance company operating in the reinsurance division.
* The system will be capable of ingesting data from various sources including files and web services, ensuring data integrity, security, and scalability.

## Technologies Used
* Python: Programming language for backend development.
* Django: High-level Python web framework for rapid development.
* Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL): For storing structured data.
* RESTful APIs: For communication between different components.
* Django REST Framework: To build RESTful APIs.
* **Celery: For task scheduling and background processing.**
* AWS S3: For storing and managing files securely.
* Djoser: For authentication and authorization.
* **Swagger/OpenAPI Specification: For documenting APIs.**

## Components:
### File Ingestor Module:
* Responsible for ingesting data from files uploaded by users or fetched from external sources.
* Validates and processes the incoming files.
* Stores the data into the database.

### Web Service Ingestor:
* Fetches data from external web services securely.
* Parses the response and validates the data.
* Stores the data into the database.

### Data Storage (Database):
* PostgreSQL database to store structured data.
*  Ensures data integrity, security, and scalability.

### Web Server:
* Hosts the Django application.
* Handles user requests, authentication, and authorization.
* Provides RESTful APIs for data ingestion and retrieval.

## Implementation Details
### File Ingestion Module
* User Interface:
* Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading files.
Supports various file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).

* File Validation:
Validates the file format, structure, and integrity.
Handles errors and provides meaningful feedback to the user.

* Data Processing:
Parses the file content and extracts relevant data.
Applies necessary transformations and mappings.

* Concurrency:
Handles concurrent file uploads efficiently.
Utilizes asynchronous processing if needed.
Web Service Ingestor

* Authentication:
Implements OAuth2 for authenticating requests to external web services.

* Data Retrieval:
Fetches data from predefined endpoints using RESTful requests.
Handles pagination and rate limiting.

* Data Parsing:
Parses the response from the web service.
Validates the data against predefined schemas.

* Error Handling:
Handles network errors, authentication failures, and unexpected responses gracefully.
Data Storage

* Schema Design:
Designs an appropriate relational database schema to store insurance-related data.

* Data Integrity:
Defines constraints and relationships to maintain data integrity.

* Performance Optimization:
Indexes frequently queried columns for improved performance.

* Backup and Recovery:
Implements regular backups and ensures mechanisms for data recovery in case of failures.

* Web Server
Authentication and Authorization:
Implements OAuth2 for user authentication.
Defines role-based access control for different endpoints.

* RESTful APIs:
Defines APIs for file upload, web service data ingestion, and data retrieval.
Documents APIs using Swagger/OpenAPI Specification.

* Concurrency and Scalability:
 * Utilizes Celery for asynchronous task processing to handle large volumes of data.
Implements caching mechanisms for improved performance.

## Conclusion
* In conclusion, this Python Django and database implementation provides a comprehensive solution for data ingestion in the reinsurance division of an insurance company.
* By leveraging Django's powerful features and integrating with various technologies, the system ensures reliability, security, and scalability in handling both file and web service-based data sources.
